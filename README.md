## Introduction
Dataset info: This dataset contains information about movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDB), and it has 10866 rows and 21 columns initially that includes (id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, ...).

In this project we will be analysing key variables in order to draw insights from them. For example, we will look at the particular genre that has generated the highest revenue over time, how the revenue of a movie is related with it's popularity (this insight is necessary because there are some movies produced that don't have much popularity internationally but has a great box-office revenue) so it is important to figure out the relationship between these variable.


## Documentation
> Data wrangling had to be done on the dataset before we could go on to the exploratory analysis. We evaluated the data to find issues with its structure and quality. Duplicate rows were evaluated and cleaned throughout this procedure, incorrect datatypes were changed to the correct datatype, non-significant null values were removed, and certain changes were made to improve the dataset's quality.



## Summary of Findings
- Action movies had the largest budget over the time period represented by the dataset, whereas TV movies had the lowest budget.
- Additionally, the highest-grossing film genre was Action, while TV movies came in last.
- It was discovered that popular films received the best reviews.
- Our research demonstrated that there is no association between movie revenue and popularity.

## Conclusion
> Analyzing this dataset comes with a bunch of limitations in the Data wrangling process, **from** checking up on duplicated values/rows, dealing wih NAN (null) values **to** modifying the dataset in order to have a quality structure.
